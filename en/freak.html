    <img class="freak__img" src="/public/img/image_album_freak.webp" alt="image de l'album thrill seeker">
    <h1 class="freak__titles2">Freak a story about a peculiar circus</h1>
     <p class="freak__quote">“Welcome to our freakshow”

      <p class="freak__content">The music is about a circus show in which people considered strange are reunited and their common point is the fact that they are rejected by others, they are even mocked for their differences and for who they are.</p>
      <p class="freak__content">The singer seems to also be  part of these “monsters” because he shows a great empathy and describe to us what the common opinion thinks and what they wanna do to these different beings, he will then tell us that people who are rejected by others are those who do not conform to the norms or who do not have the same opinions as the majority, Those who live according to their desires and instincts.</p>
      
      <p class="freak__quote">“Please do not hide, their imperfect nature”</p>
      
      <p class="freak__content">This quote is a request even a plea from the singer who would like to see different people being treated properly and being able to their lives without the need to hide, conform or live in shame, he says this because these imperfections are natural we were born with them, and we have no control over what makes us different, thus rejecting the “monsters” makes no sense and is unfair.</p>
      <p class="freak__quote">“It’s hard to find the cure when there’s no disease”</p>
      <p class="freak__content">This other quote confirms that for the singer difference is in no way a disease or a weakness and that no one should have to submit to absurd standards.</p>
     </p>
    <h1 class="freak__titles2">The main themes of the song</h1>
    <p class="freak__content">The main theme is once again the difference and accepting and being proud of your flaws and differences because they are what makes you a unique being despite the common sense not agreeing. These lyrics are available with a music video on Youtube. The singer also denounces the fact that some will use these people to make themselves rich or for other selfish reasons
      </p>
      <div><p class="freak__exergue">“oh such a fine collection of strange things”</p></div>
    <h1 class="freak__titles2">The Show begins</h1>
    <p class="freak__content">This clip show us a circus troupe filled with diverse people with special physical characteristics: we have a snake lady, a contortionist, a man with superstrength, these characters all seem to have fun without being embarrassed by their peculiar appearances they take advantage of these peculiarities to bring the circus to life and because they are surrounded by people like them in front of who they will not have to seem “perfect” and with who they are comfortable. </p> 
    <p class="freak__content">However the end of the clip also shows us the dark side of the circus with characters that are used and put in dangerous situations just to entertain other people, It is a parallel to the real life where this kind of circus has already existed or simply on social networks where people will be mocked for their differences, their cultures, their ethnicities, their gender identity or their sexuality.</p>
      <p class="freak__content">The singer shows us through this playful and fascinating clip to denounce certain acts made against people that society rejects.</p>
    <h1 class="freak__titles2">A singer with a fascinating mind</h1>
